          <h1>M. Scott Conner's Resume and Project Page</h1>

      <p>I spent most of 2014-16 working for Google Express in Boston (operated by Adecco) while my wife went to school.  I had approached Adecco looking for work just to keep us afloat, but when I got there I found that the organization had a lot to teach me about developing a professional culture, developing a new organization, and the process of developing the tools that it could use to meet its goals.  While I was in Boston I also played a few concerts in the Boston Civic Orchestra in the French horn section.  I also composed my first ever original music while playing bass in a progressive rock trio.  After my wife graduated we spent all of June hiking the 273 miles of the Long Trail in Vermont with our dog Atticus.</p>
      <p>During this time I also set my sights on becoming a professional computer programmer.  I began to develop spreadsheet based tools at Google Express that required me to think about logical outcomes.  I watched my coworkers use these tools and I learned to tweak our tools so that they would be easier to understand, less buggy, and generally more successful.  I took advantage of online resources that taught me the foundations of general coding practices, an Java in particular, and I learned about the careers I could pursue with programming skills.  I thought that with the requisite coding knowledge and my knowledge of how to be an effective worker, I could be a valuable asset to any organization.  And that is my goal.  I'm striving to prove that I can be an effective programmer, and that I can provide value to an employer on multiple levels.</p>
      <p>This page shows some of the projects I have worked on, and demonstrates some of the skills i have acquired over the last year or so.  I have included some personal information as well so you can get to know me a little better, so please feel free to explore the site.</p>

      <h2>Ride Share Tracking</h2>
      <p>As a side job while studing code, I have been driving for the ride share company Lyft.  They have a dashboard to track driver data but I found that I wanted to track additional information, so I developed a form that tracks my miles, drive time, and money earned.
      With this data I can calculate and display useful metrics such as dollars/hour after Lyft fees and fuel costs are subtracted,
      and to determine the most profitable times for me to drive (partitoned into days of the week, hours of the day, etc).
      Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqjQtEpZLNDYmZIZPAEbOhD8v-L31EbE8vX2rxZ2hgh7FXYw/viewform">copy of the form</a> and below is the spreadsheet where I collect and display the data.</p>

      <h2>Recreational Accomplishments</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by my sister, I decided to run a marathon before I turned 30.  So in 2010, having never ran more than 7 or 8 miles, I researched and decided on Hal Higdon's 20 week training program and ended up finishing within 2.5 minutes of qualifying for the Boston Marathon in my age group.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2016 my wife and I decided to hike the Long Trail in Vermont, which starts at the Massachusetts border, run over the Green Mountains for 273 miles, and ends at the Canadian border.  Previous to this we had never even been on an overnight hike, so it was key to research the required gear, physical training, food preparation, as well as how to safely take our dog Atticus.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have played on competitive ultimate frisbee teams, and captained a couple of recreational ultimate frisbee league teams in Kansas City.  I have also played disc golf for more than a decade, and I have five hole-in-ones to my name.
      </p>
      <p>
        I played horn with the Kansas City Civic Orchestra, and with the Moon City Brass Quintet in 2013, and I played bass with the Moon City Big Band 2012-13.  I played horn with the Boston Civic Orchestra in 2014-15.  While in Boston I also wrote my first original compositions with two bandmates, and we recorded five of our instrumental rock tunes (available to stream <a href="https://verbthenoun2.bandcamp.com/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also involved in the musical theater scene in Kansas City, where I played upright bass in The New Theatre Restaurant's 2010 production of "Buddy - the Buddy Holly Story".  They needed an extra guitarist when they reprised the show in 2013, so I learned guitar for the show and even performed several shows as understudy to the Fourth Cricket when our "Buddy" was sick.  I also played French horn in Musical Theater Heritage's production of "Sundays In The Park With George" (here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/6SyTZzUWKdM">dress rehearsal recording</a> where you can hear the <a href="https://youtu.be/6SyTZzUWKdM?t=123">horn part around 2:03</a> over the words "there are Louis's...")
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my more frivolous skills include juggling, solving Rubik's cubes, unicycling, Sudoku, Ken-Ken, handstands, and tying bowties.
