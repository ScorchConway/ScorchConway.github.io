          <h2>M. Scott Conner's Resume and Project Page</h2>

      <p>I spent most of 2014-16 working for Google Express in Boston (operated by Adecco) while my wife went to school.  I had approached Adecco looking for work just to keep us afloat, but when I got there I found that the organization had a lot to teach me about developing a professional culture, developing a new organization, and the process of developing the tools that it could use to meet its goals.  While I was in Boston I also played a few concerts in the Boston Civic Orchestra in the French horn section.  I also composed my first ever original music while playing bass in a progressive rock trio.  After my wife graduated we spent all of June hiking the 273 miles of the Long Trail in Vermont with our dog Atticus.</p>
      <p>During this time I also set my sights on becoming a professional computer programmer.  I began to develop spreadsheet based tools at Google Express that required me to think about logical outcomes.  I watched my coworkers use these tools and I learned to tweak our tools so that they would be easier to understand, less buggy, and generally more successful.  I took advantage of online resources that taught me the foundations of general coding practices, an Java in particular, and I learned about the careers I could pursue with programming skills.  I thought that with the requisite coding knowledge and my knowledge of how to be an effective worker, I could be a valuable asset to any organization.  And that is my goal.  I'm striving to prove that I can be an effective programmer, and that I can provide value to an employer on multiple levels.</p>
      <p>This page shows some of the projects I have worked on, and demonstrates some of the skills i have acquired over the last year or so.  I have included some personal information as well so you can get to know me a little better, so please feel free to explore the site.</p>

        <td>I wrote this code for a problem set in MIT's online course <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/software-construction-java-mitx-6-005-1x">Software Construction in Java</a>.  The Library interface, as well as the parameters for the Book and BookCopy ADTs were provided.  The problem set included implementing BigLibrary (which implemented the Library Interface), implementing the Book and BookCopy ADTs, and writing JUnit tests.</td>

The class focuses on building a todo list as a web app.  Here I show the finished project, and a version of the project with a few more added bells and whistles.</td>

        <td>Lyft Tracking Form</td>
        <td>As a side job while studing code, I have been driving for the ride share company Lyft.  They have a dashboard to track driver data but I found that I wanted to track additional information, so I developed a form that tracks my miles, drive time, and money earned.  With this data I can calculate and display useful metrics such as dollars/hour after Lyft fees and fuel costs are subtracted.  I can also use this information to determine which times are the most profitable for me to drive (like days of the week, hours of the day, etc.)</td>
